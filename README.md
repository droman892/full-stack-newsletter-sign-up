## Description

<p align="center"> This application was built specifically with the intention of incorporating Redux, server-side page rendering and routing, and a cloud database.</p>

<p align="center"> Users are able to enjoy a standardized layout with a top navigation and footer, with the top-nav converting into a side-nav for smaller viewports. Data submitted with the form can immediately be viewed from the MongoDB Atlas web console.</p>
